    <h3 style="color: #B60E62; text-decoration: underline;"> Proposition for a fiction airline company (Calico Air)</h3>
    This project was all about creating a proposition for a potential redesign of a fictional airline's website where we had to first understand and write about what users wants and needs in an airline website for processes such as booking their flights and generally when they are looking and using a website. Then we took this knowledge and applied it to wireframes and through commentary on specific techniques ad principes we found out and used, we explained how this website would be attractive and efficient for user experience.

    <h3 style="color: #B60E62; text-decoration: underline;">Design Psychology - Food</h3>
    In this part of the project, we were learning the psychological components of eating and applying them through design concepts through the idea of reducing portion sizes of food that is directly linked to the global problem of obesity. Our project was to summarise at least four of a list of articles relating to design psychology and then apply those same ideas to three design concepts that would benefit the user experience in terms of reducing their total portion sizes of food. We also had to make a presentation of our concepts which had to be a maximum of two minutes which you will be able to see in my attached zoom presentation under the pdf.

    <h3 style="color: #B60E62; text-decoration: underline;">Website for how networks run in Tawa (My place of residence)</h3>
    In this project, we had to take what we had leanrt very early in the course about networks run and transfer information to each other, and investigate how that process works in the areas that we reside in (for me it was Tawa). This as such was a mini kind of project and the lecturer just wanted to see how much of the backround information we knew before progressing to more advanced material later on into the course of Internet and Social Media Design.   </section>

    <h3 style="color: #B60E62; text-decoration: underline;">Internet-based project - Create a Company</h3>
    This was one of my favorite projects to do as it mixed a little graphic design and interaction design work too. There were three parts to this project in which the first part was to take a look at the lecture contents/videos over the past few weeks (early half of the trimester) and understand/summarize what it would mean and how you would implement that understand to create a potential internet design project (i did a website) that would beneift users in some area of the world wide web/internet platform. The second part was to come up with an original company name that would serve the puspose of what you learnt from the lecture content and design logos, typography, colour, etc to go with that company name. The third part was to create a presentation with all that information in which you also add what your overall internet design project is about and how your company will benefit user experience on the internet through also referring to the content learned in class.

      <h3 style="color: #B60E62; text-decoration: underline;">Original App Creation</h3>
      
Investigating a specific problem within the teenage - young adult age group and then designing something (whether it be digital of physical) was the gist of this project and I decided to do an app named "Social Media Controller" which acts as a tool for helping the target audience to sleep more through means of helping them control their use of social media apps the night before which was the main purpose of my investigation.

    <h3 style="color: #B60E62; text-decoration: underline;">Interactive Object/Website Concept Project</h3>
    One of my first ever projects for my major of interaction design at University was a mix between website and object design where we had to Investigate a problem or an area that can be approved specifically in uni life for students that can benefit them and make their lives a bit easier. The three parts to this project was firstly to investigate and come up with a purpose for the project through means of primary and secondary research and with this, we had to create a journey map. Secondly we had to create a sort of website that would digitally and more interactively display the purpose of the journey maps. The last step was to physically create the object that would solve the problem/issue that was picked and so i created a small waller like object with a lever that would allow faster scannig of uni cards, solving the problem of time wasting of the card scanning process.

    <h3 style="color: #B60E62; text-decoration: underline;">An environmentally beneficial app</h3>
    
This was a project that was included in one of my elctive courses to do with Sustainable Design however was very much an interaction design project in which i used my skills for interaction design (my major) to complete it. The objective of this assesment was to specifically focus on how you can create awareness and solve the potential issue of students in Victoria University (of Wellington) shopping for their groceries in an unethical manner towards the environemt (due to their other commitments/responsibilities). You could create omething physically or digitally in which i chose to create an app that allows for students to gain information about facts relating to transport and the environent and allowing them to track their ways of transport and keep up-to-date with their progress.
